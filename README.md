# Very Best

Refresh your memory about the Very Best app from [the Week 1 ERD exercise](https://guides.firstdraft.com/appdev-primer.html#very-best-erd).

Your goal in this project is to start from the prototype generated by the firstdraft Ideas tool and improve the interface to match [the target](http://very-best-demo-pr-3.herokuapp.com/).

hi guys

## Setup

Please see [this guide](https://guides.firstdraft.com/very-best-project-guide.html) for detailed instructions.

## Standard Workflow

 1. From [your Cloud9 repositories list](https://c9.io/account/repos), set up a workspace [as usual](https://guides.firstdraft.com/starting-on-a-project-in-cloud9).
 1. Set up the project: `bin/setup`
 1. Start the web server by clicking "Run Project".
 1. Navigate to your live application preview.
 1. As you work, remember to navigate to `/git` and **commit often as you work.**
 1. Make new branches freely to experiment! _Especially_ before starting on a new task.
 1. Run `rails grade` as often as you like to see how you are doing, but **make sure you test your app manually first to make sure it matches the target's behavior first**.
